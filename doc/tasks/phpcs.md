# Phpcs ![fixer](https://img.shields.io/badge/-fixer-informational)

The Phpcs task will sniff your code for bad coding standards.

***Composer***

```
composer require --dev squizlabs/php_codesniffer
```

***Config***

The task lives under the `phpcs` namespace and has following configurable parameters:

```yaml
# grumphp.yml
grumphp:
    tasks:
        phpcs:
            standard: []
            severity: ~
            error_severity: ~
            warning_severity: ~
            tab_width: ~
            report: full
            report_width: ~
            whitelist_patterns: []
            encoding: ~
            ignore_patterns: []
            sniffs: []
            triggered_by: [php]
            exclude: []
            show_sniffs_error_path: true
```

**standard**

*Default: []*

This parameter will describe which standard/s is being used to validate your code for bad coding standards.
By default, it is set to null so that the Phpcs defaults are being used.
Phpcs will be using the PEAR or local `phpcs.xml` standard by default.
You can configure this task to use any standard supported by the Phpcs CLI.
For Example: `PEAR`, `PHPCS`, `PSR1`, `PSR2`, `PSR12`, `Squiz` and `Zend`

You can get a list of all installed phpcs standards with the command:

```sh
phpcs -i
```

**severity**

*Default: null*

Global severity level that should be used by `phpcs` (default is 5).

**error_severity**

*Default: null*

Error severity that should be used by `phpcs` (default is 5).

**warning_severity**

*Default: null*

Warning severity that should be used by `phpcs` (default is 5).

**tab_width**

*Default: null*

By default, the standard will specify the optimal tab-width of the code. If you want to overwrite this option, you can use this configuration option.

**encoding**

*Default: null*

The default encoding used by PHP_CodeSniffer (is ISO-8859-1).

**report**

*Default: full*

The report type output by PHP_CodeSniffer, put `code` to see a code snippet of the offending code.
Consult the [complete list](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Configuration-Options#setting-the-default-report-format) for more formats.

**report_width**

*Default: null*

PHP_CodeSniffer will print all screen-based reports 80 characters wide. You may override this size so that long lines do not wrap.

**whitelist_patterns**

*Default: []*

This is a list of regex patterns that will filter files to validate. With this option you can skip files like tests. This option is used in relation with the parameter `triggered_by`.
For example to validate only files in your `src/App/` and `src/AppBundle/` directories in a Symfony you can use 
```yml
whitelist_patterns:
  - /^src\/App\/(.*)/
  - /^src\/AppBundle\/(.*)/
```


**ignore_patterns**

*Default: []*

This is a list of patterns that will be ignored by phpcs. With this option you can skip files like tests. Leave this option blank to run phpcs for every php file.


**sniffs**

*Default: []*

This is a list of sniffs that need to be executed. Leave this option blank to run all configured sniffs for the selected standard.

**triggered_by**

*Default: [php]:

This is a list of extensions to be sniffed. This list is also passed to phpcs using the `--extensions` parameter.

**exclude**

*Default: []*

A list of rules that should not be checked. Leave this option blank to run all configured rules for the selected standard.

**show_sniffs_error_path**

*Default: true*

Displays the sniff that triggered the error, allowing you to more easily find the specific rules with their namespaces.

"scripts": {
    "post-install-cmd": "vendor/bin/phpcs --config-set installed_paths ../../magento/magento-coding-standard/",
    "post-update-cmd": "vendor/bin/phpcs --config-set installed_paths ../../magento/magento-coding-standard/"
}
```

Following this, you can add the path to your phpcs task.
```yaml
# gumphp.yml
grumphp:
    tasks:
        phpcs:
            standard: "Magento2"
```

### Drupal
