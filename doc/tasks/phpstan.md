# PHPStan

The PHPStan task focuses on finding errors in your code without actually running it. It catches whole classes of bugs even before you write tests for the code.
It lives under the `phpstan` namespace and has following configurable parameters:

## Composer
```bash
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan
```

## Config
```yaml
# grumphp.yml
grumphp:
    tasks:
        phpstan:
            autoload_file: ~
            configuration: ~
            level: 0
            force_patterns: []
            ignore_patterns: []
            triggered_by: ['php']
            memory_limit: "-1"
            use_grumphp_paths: true
```

**autoload_file**

*Default: null*

With this parameter you can specify the path your project's additional autoload file path.

**configuration**

*Default: null*

With this parameter you can specify the path your project's configuration file.
By leaving null, GrumPHP will look if you have a phpstan.neon or phpstan.neon.dist config file ([default values](https://phpstan.org/config-reference#config-file)).

**level**

*Default: 0*

With this parameter you can set the level of rule options - the higher the stricter.

**force_patterns**

*Default: []*

This is a list of patterns that will be forced for analysis even when the file or path is ignored.

**ignore_patterns**

*Default: []*

This is a list of patterns that will be ignored by phpstan. With this option you can skip files like tests. Leave this option blank to run phpstan for every php file.

**triggered_by**

*Default: [php]*

This is a list of extensions to be sniffed.

**memory_limit**

*Default: null*

With this parameter you can specify the memory limit.


**use_grumphp_paths**

*Default: true*

Since there is no `--changed-files` flag [in PhpStan yet](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/issues/934#issuecomment-383002766),
this flags allows you to change what files will be validated.
You can choose to use the paths detected by GrumPHP, or you can choose to fall back on the PhpStan configuration.
