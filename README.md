# GrumPHP

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpro/grumphp/master/resources/logo/grumphp-grumpy.png" align="right" width="250"/>

Sick and tired of defending code quality over and over again? GrumPHP will do it for you!
This composer plugin will register some git hooks in your package repository.
When somebody commits changes, GrumPHP will run some tests on the committed code.
If the tests fail, you won't be able to commit your changes.
This handy tool will not only improve your codebase, it will also teach your co-workers to write better code following the best practices you've determined as a team.

GrumPHP has a set of common tasks built-in. You will be able to use GrumPHP with a minimum of configuration.

We don't want to bore you with all the details, so quick: install it yourself and unleash the power of GrumPHP!

## Demo

*If you are trying to install GrumPHP on Windows: please read the windows pre-install section.*

This package is a composer plugin and should be installed to your project's dev dependency using composer:

```sh
composer require --dev phpro/grumphp
```

When the package is installed, GrumPHP will attach itself to the git hooks of your project.
You will see following message in the composer logs:

*Watch out! GrumPHP is sniffing your commits!*

Some things in GrumPHP can be configured in a `grumphp.yml` or `grumphp.yml.dist` file in the root of your project (the directory where you run the grumphp command).
You can specify a custom config filename and location in `composer.json` or in the `--config` option of the console commands.

## Roadmap

Lots of tasks are already available to make sure your team writes great code.
There is one major part missing before we can release v1.0.0:

- [A PHAR executable](https://github.com/phpro//grumphp/issues/61)

We are always looking to support new tasks. 
Feel free to log an issue or create a pull request for a task we forgot.
